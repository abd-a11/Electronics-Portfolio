A synchronous voltage converter is a type of DC-DC converter that uses active switches (typically MOSFETs) instead of diodes for rectification. This improves efficiency, especially at low output voltages and high currents.

Key Features of a Synchronous Voltage Converter:
Active Rectification:

Unlike traditional non-synchronous converters that use Schottky diodes for rectification, synchronous converters use a MOSFET as the rectifier (synchronous switch).
The MOSFET has a much lower ON resistance (R_DS(on)) than a diode’s forward voltage drop, reducing power loss.
Higher Efficiency:

Since MOSFETs have lower conduction losses compared to diodes, efficiency increases, especially for low-voltage high-current applications like CPUs, GPUs, and mobile devices.
Types of Synchronous Voltage Converters:

Synchronous Buck Converter – Steps down voltage efficiently.
Synchronous Boost Converter – Steps up voltage while improving efficiency.
Synchronous Buck-Boost Converter – Can both step up and step down voltage.
Controller Mechanism:

Requires a PWM controller with gate drive signals to switch the MOSFETs properly.
Typically includes dead-time control to prevent both MOSFETs from conducting at the same time (which would cause a short circuit).
